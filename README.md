# Using_NLP_toCheckGrammarErrors
I'm using some NLP techniques to check the grammar and spelling of sentences. 

The model should be better trained for differences in words with very similar spelling, but for a basic context it works perfectly. 

I accept and review pull requests and possible improvements.
